Hello! 

My name is Mustafa, this is my OOP gaming project-1
this game was based on 2 assighnment that were given
to me during my course and the above game is build on that.

#1
Objective:
1. To understand how the Abstract class and abstract functions work
2. To understand runtime-polymorphism
3. To translate UML class diagrams into working code
4. To understand preliminary AI by adding behavior to objects
5. To understand the working of a doubly linked list

#2
Objective:

Incorporate design patterns in your code

Tasks:

This assignment builds up on your previous assignment. You will need to change the code in the previous assignment to incorporate design patterns and do a few more optimizations

1. You will convert your Player class into a Singleton

2. You will create an abstract factory known as FactoryCreator

3. FactoryCreator will create two Factories, PlaneFactory and ProjectileFactory

4. PlaneFactory will create the Fighter and Bomber objects

5. ProjectileFactory will create PlayerFire and EnemyFire objects

6. Enemies will fire the EnemyFire Object at random intervals and the player will need to avoid them

7. You may define EnemyFiire to fall down

8. Remove your own defined linked list with ArrayList


These were the 2 assighnments which ended up in my project.


Controls:

Arrow keys to move the player.
Space key to shoot.
